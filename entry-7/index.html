  <h1>The Rise of Trinkets in Digital Spaces</h1>
  <body>
  <p>Humans collect things because our brains are wired to assign emotional and cognitive value to objects. The act of collecting activates the dopamine reward system, the same circuitry involved in motivation and pleasure. Each time we acquire a new item, dopamine creates a sense of satisfaction and anticipation, encouraging us to continue seeking the next find. Psychologists also link collecting to the need for control and identity formation—objects act as external markers of memory, taste, or personal history. From an evolutionary perspective, collecting once ensured survival: storing resources meant security during periods of scarcity. Today, that instinct persists, but instead of food or tools, we often accumulate symbolic items—postcards, vinyl records, or shoes—that help us create meaning, preserve memories, and shape our sense of self.</p>
  <p>Recently, I've been noticing a trend of collecting items, and while I'm limited to a tiny dorm that I share with a friend, if I had a bookshelf, this is what will be on it.</p>
