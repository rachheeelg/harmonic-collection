  <p>Imagine a world without colour, that would be awful ain't it!</p>
  <p>In art school, the first few things they've taught us is to be more intuitive when it comes down to colour. It was something that is foundational, across different fields. A way that my graphic design teacher has taught us so far is to get inspired by fine art, and to collect art references. Overtime, I started collecting paintings and understanding compositions. There are a million and 1, colour theory books out there, some of which of my personal favourite I would link underneath. But this entry is to explore the paintings that I've been inspired in terms of colour!</p>
