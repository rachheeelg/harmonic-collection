    <h1>The Fascination of Lamps and Graphic Design</h1>
    <h2>Ever wondered why graphic designers are fascinated by lamps?</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Graphic designers have a strange, almost spiritual relationship with lamps. This week's entry is not exactly a graphic design resource, but rather, a physical manifestation of perhaps why lamps are so highly regarded by graphic designers. Maybe it's the warm glow, maybe it's the promise of a long night of "just fixing this one thing," or maybe we're all just one bad critique away from buying another mood-setting object. Either way, if you ever want to lure a designer into a room, don't bother with snacks — just switch on a nice lamp.</p>
