  <p>Risograph printing offers a playful, tactile approach to modern printmaking, bold colour, soft texture, and unexpected charm in every run.</p>
  <p>Working like a bridge between screen printing and digital duplication, the Risograph creates prints one vivid ink layer at a time. Each colour is applied through a master stencil, burned directly onto a thin sheet and wrapped around an ink drum that spins at high speed.</p>
  <p>As paper feeds through, soy-based inks are pushed through the screen, building rich, overlapping tones with slight shifts and misregistrations that make each print feel alive.</p>
  <p>Affordable, efficient, and more sustainable than many traditional methods, risograph printing celebrates imperfection while keeping production low-waste and vibrant.</p>
  <h2>Steps for to use a risograph!</h2>
  <body>
  <h3>Prep your artwork (one colour = one layer).</h3>
    <p>Separate your design into spot-colour layers (e.g., Fluoro Pink, Medium Blue). For each layer, use grayscale art where black = print, white = no ink. Add small registration marks.</p>
    <h3>Load the first colour drum.</h3>
    <p>Slide in the ink drum you want to print first. (Each drum holds one ink colour.)</p>
    <h3>Send or scan the file.</h3>
    <p>You can scan a physical original on the bed or send a digital file. The machine treats what it receives as a single-colour layer.</p>
    <h3>The master is made-auto-stencil.</h3>
    <p>A roll of thermo-sensitive “master” paper feeds inside. A thermal head burns tiny holes where your image is dark, creating a stencil. The machine wraps this master around the ink drum.</p>
    <h3>Set paper + stock settings.</h3>
    <p>Load your paper: pick the correct weight setting and tray guides. Heavier stocks usually benefit from slower speeds and higher print pressure.</p>
    <h3>Run test prints and adjust.</h3>
    <p>Print 1-3 tests. Tweak density (ink amount), speed, and image position (tiny nudge controls) until the layer looks clean and centered.</p>
    <h3>Print the first colour run.</h3>
    <p>The drum spins at high speed; a pressure roller pulls paper across the drum as soy-based ink is pushed through the master onto the sheet. You now have colour #1.</p>
    <h3>Swap drums for the next colour.</h3>
    <p>Eject the first master (it's single-use), load the next colour drum, and create a new master from the next layer file.</p>
    <h3>Register the second colour.</h3>
    <p>Use your registration marks to align. Print tests, micro-adjust X/Y. Slight misregistration is normal (and part of the Riso look).</p>
    <h3>Repeat for additional colours.</h3>
    <p>Each extra colour = new drum + new master + alignment. Overprinting layers creates new blended tones.</p>
    <h3>Dry the prints.</h3>
    <p>Riso inks are oil-based and can offset when stacked. Lay prints in short stacks or on drying racks until surface-dry.</p>
    <h3>Finish + clean down.</h3>
    <p>Trim, fold, or bind. Recycle used masters, wipe any stray ink, and store drums properly for next time.</p>
