<h1>Risograph Around the World!</h1>
 <h2>What is a Risograph?</h2> 
<body>
  <p>Risograph printing offers a playful, tactile approach to modern printmaking, bold colour, soft texture, and unexpected charm in every run.</p>
  <p>Working like a bridge between screen printing and digital duplication, the Risograph creates prints one vivid ink layer at a time. Each colour is applied through a master stencil, burned directly onto a thin sheet and wrapped around an ink drum that spins at high speed.</p>
  <p>As paper feeds through, soy-based inks are pushed through the screen, building rich, overlapping tones with slight shifts and misregistrations that make each print feel alive. </p>
  <p>Affordable, efficient, and more sustainable than many traditional methods, risograph printing celebrates imperfection while keeping production low-waste and vibrant.</p>

<p>In EDOCHROME E1DO, Edo Saputra takes us on a journey back to analog photography. After 15 years away from it, Edo returned to film during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Using his Nikon FM2 and Nikon F90x, he explored the distinct limitations and beauty of analog filmâ€”36 frames per roll, the character of different films, and the precision needed for every shot.

Inspired by the Kodak Ektachrome E100 slide film, Edo reimagined his street photography by selecting and repackaging the images into a 1:2 scale roll.
