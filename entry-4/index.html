  <h1>Do you know your design studios?</h1>
 <h2>Who designed this garbage?</h2> 
 <p>I was scrolling through Instagram the other day, and I saw this account that was rather conscipious, on who designed this piece of trash. Here are some of my favourite picks that I found, as well as design studios behind the "trash".</p>
 <br>
  <h3>POPEYES by Pentagram Design</h3>

 <p>In 2008, Popeyes underwent a comprehensive brand transformation to emphasize its distinctive Louisiana heritage. As part of this initiative, Austin, Texas-based Pentagram Design was charged with the transition to a more contemporary logo and visual brand identity.</p>
 <br>
  <h3>Bread Alone Bakery by Milton Glaser</h3>

 <p></p>A highly influential graphic designer known for creating the iconic "I [heart] NY" logo. He developed the identity and branding for Bread Alone Bakery, which led to a 20% increase in sales, according to a case study on his website.</p>
 <br>
 <h3>Omny Card</h3>

 <p>Working with Britt Cobb at Pentagram, Christian Schwartz drew a split-stroke all-caps display typeface in 2019 for OMNY, the new contactless payment system for New York mass transit. OMNY Titling is designed to work alongside Helvetica in the identity, though its rounds are drawn to look circular so the O in OMNY could harmonize better with the existing MTA logo (designed by Siegel + Gale) and it could function as an icon for the mobile app. Schwartz also drew the logotype, based on Britt's sketches, with optical sizes for large and small use.</p>
<br>
<h3>Aritzia</h3>

<p>Aritzia's brand narrative is everyday luxury for everyone and every occasion. With their collection, consumers can elevate and expand their individual style in a way that is comfortable for them. I think the physical and digital spaces reinforce each other to convey this story.</p>
